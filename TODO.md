## Plan

Convert the multi-page portfolio into a single-page portfolio by integrating all sections into index.html.

1. **index.html** (Main Single Page):

   - Update hero section with name "BETELHEM TAYE", title "Software Engineering Student | Full-Stack Web Developer".
   - Update typed items to "SOFTWARE, Developer,".
   - Update social links with placeholders (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).
   - Add About section after Hero.
   - [x] Add Resume section.
   - [x] Remove Stats section (happy client section).
   - [x] Update Skills section to show only logos/icons without text names.
   - [x] Remove percent from skills section.
   - [x] Add Portfolio section with updated projects: Netflix Clone, Amazon Clone, Evangadi Forum.
     - [x] Use respective images (Netflix-clone.png, amazon-clone.png, Evangadi Forum.png).
     - On hover, show project name on image.
     - [x] On click, open modal with title, description, Live Demo button, GitHub button.
   - Add Contact section.
   - Update navigation to scroll to sections (e.g., #about, #resume, etc.).
   - Update footer sitename to "Betelhem Taye".
   - [x] Add Bootstrap modals for project details.

2. **Other HTML Files**:
   - Since it's single-page, other files (about.html, resume.html, etc.) can be removed or kept as backups, but navigation will point to sections in index.html.

## Dependent Files to Edit

- index.html (major updates to make it single-page)

## Followup Steps

- [x] Verify all sections are integrated and consistent.
- [x] Test the website by opening index.html in browser.
- [x] Make portfolio card sizes equal.
- [x] Make popup messages interactive with black background.
- [x] Make buttons green.
- [x] Ensure all images in portfolio cards and modals have consistent sizes.
- [x] Make interests section icons static (no redirects).
- Ensure navigation scrolls to sections.
- Ensure responsive design and links work.
